Events are the reason for webhooks: webhooks are a way for your Adobe Sign integration to listen for and respond to Adobe Sign events. This page provides the info you need to determine what events your integration will listen for and respond to, and what details are included in event notifications so you can design your integration to extract the info you need from an event.

## Notification payload for events

When configuring a webhook, you can choose which events for which you would like to receive payloads. Subscribing only to the specific events is useful for limiting the number of HTTPS requests to the server. You can change the list of subscribed events through the API or UI anytime.

Currently webhooks can be created only for agreement, widget, and megasign events. Each event has a similar JSON schema based on the resource type, but a unique payload object that is determined by its event type. The payload will be returned in JSON format.

This table displays the events and payload which will be sent in webhook notifications.

### Payload info

Webhook notification payloads will be delivered using the application/json content type.

The payload object contains all the relevant information about what just happened, including the type of event and the data associated with that event. Adobe Sign then sends the payload object, via an HTTP POST request, to any endpoint URLs that you have defined as webhook URLs. The payload size is restricted to 10 MB.

If an event generates a larger payload, a webhook will triggered but the conditional parameters attributes, if theyâ€™re in the request, will be removed to reduce the size of the payload. Also a **conditionalParametersTrimmed** array object will be included in the response for this case to tell the client which conditionalParameters info is removed.

The truncation will be done in the following order:

-   **includeSignedDocuments**
-   **includeParticipantsInfo**
-   **includeDocumentsInfo**
-   **includeDetailedInfo**

Signed Documents(base 64 encoded format) will be truncated first if size exceeds, followed by participant info, document info and finally detailed info will be truncated.

This may happen, for example, on an agreement completion event if it includes signed document (base 64 encoded format) as well or for an agreement with multiple form fields.

### Basic webhook payload for all notifications

All events will include the following common attributes in their payloads. Additional parameters returned along with basic agreement/widget/megasign info in the payload JSON object for particular keys are defined in the payload specificiations for each event; see [Notification payload for events](#notificationpayloadforevents) for links.

| Parameter name | Type | Description | Possible values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `webhookId` | String | Webhook identifier of the webhook for which the notification is being sent |   |
| `webhookname` | String | Name of the webhook which was provided while creating a webhook |   |
| `webhookNotificationId` | String | The unique identifier of the webhook notification. This will be helpful in identifying duplicate notifications, if any. |   |

Say User C is in Group G2. Say both these groups and all 3 users are in Account A. Assume, group level &ldquo;webhook W1&rdquo; is registered on Group G1 and group level &ldquo;webhook W2&rdquo; is registered on Group G2. Now an agreement is sent by User A and to User B. And User B delegates the signing to User C. In the above case, the sign will generate only two notifications (corresponding to W1 and W2) for the delegation event. Current field for W1 notification will be an array of details of User A and User B. Current field for W2 notification will be an array of details of User C. |   |

For different MegaSign events, the detailed agreement info, participant info, document info, and the signed document will be returned based on the conditional parameters specified during webhook creation.

## Receiving a webhook notification

Once your webhook URL is added, your app will start receiving "notification requests" every time a subscribed event is triggered in Sign. A notification request is an HTTPS POST request with a JSON body. The request&rsquo;s POST parameters will contain JSON data relevant to the event that triggered the request.

Additionally, we perform an implicit verification of intent in each webhook notification request that we send to the webhook URL. Thus, every notification request will also include a header called `X-AdobeSign-ClientId` that includes client id of the application that created the webhook. We will consider the webhook notification successfully delivered, if an only if success response **(2XX response code)** is returned  and  the header **(X-AdobeSign-ClientId)** is echoed back in response HTTP header or in a JSON response body with key as **xAdobeSignClientId** and value as the same client id, otherwise we will retry to deliver the notification to the webhook URL until the retries are exhausted.

## Reliable delivery of webhook notifications

Adobe Sign incorporates an advanced, reliable strategy for delivery of webhook notifications. If there is an outage on the receiving end (suppose, for instance, the customerâ€™s server is down), Adobe Sign will retry the notification at a later timeâ€”minutes or hours later.

Undelivered events will be persisted in a retry queue and a best effort will be made over the next 72 hours to deliver the notifications in the order they occurred to the client-provided endpoints. The strategy for retrying delivery of notifications is a doubling of time between attempts, starting with a one-minute interval and doubling the interval with each attempt, up to a maximum interval of 12 hours, resulting in 15 retries in the space of 72 hours. If the webhook fails to respond and either the maximum retry time or the maximum retry interval is exceeded, the webhook will be disabled. No notifications will be sent to the webhook URL until the webhook is activated again; all the notifications between the time the webhook is disabled and enabled again will be lost.

## Webhook uniqueness 

Adobe Sign does not allow the creation of duplicate webhooks. The uniqueness of a webhook is based on a combination of the following attributes:

-   Subscription event
-   URL
-   Scope/ResoureType
-   Resource ID
-   Application ID/Client ID that you are using for the API call
-   Creator of webhook (not considered in the cases of group level and account
    level webhooks)

If a webhookâ€™s status is changed from INACTIVE to ACTIVE and another webhook with a similar configuration already exists in the ACTIVE state, the activation call will fail.

### SuperSet events

If you want to subscribe for all the agreement, widget or megaSign events, you can subscribe to the following events:

| Event type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AGREEMENT_ALL` | All the supported agreement events. If new agreement events are added in future, those events will be taken care automatically. |
| `LIBRARY_ALL` | For all the supported library document events. If new library document events are added in future that are supported for webhooks, those events will be taken care of automatically. |
| `WIDGET_ALL`  | All the supported widget events. If new widget events are added in future, those events will be taken care automatically. |
| `MEGASIGN_ALL` | All the supported megasign events. |
