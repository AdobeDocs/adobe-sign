# Get an Agreementâ€™s Status

This sample client demonstrates how to to get status of all agreements of an account and display their agreement ID, name and status.

**IMPORTANT:**

1. Before running this sample, check that you have modified the JSON file OAuthCredentials.json with appropriate values. Which values need to be specified is indicated in the file.
2. You can also provide your OAuth access token in the `OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` constant in the `RestApiOAuthTokens` class, which will then be used as the OAuth access token for making API calls.
3. You can also provide a refresh token in the `OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN constant` in the `RestApiOAuthTokens` class to refresh the OAuth access token.
