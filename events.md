# Events

Adobe Sign capabilities can be incorporated into external applications by directly embedding the Adobe Sign user interface (UI) within these applications. Adobe Sign also supports sending events (status updates) to the third-party application pages so that the external application is aware of the actions that the user is performing with the Adobe Sign UI. These events are passed between the controller window and a receiver window running on different domains for event communication.

This page provides a guide to all the events supported by Adobe Sign.

## **System requirements**

To use the event framework within Adobe Sign, you need a browser that supports `postMessage`. See  [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage) to get a list of all supported browsers.

## **Supported events**

The following table lists the Adobe Sign supported UI events that can be embedded and presented within the UI of external applications.

### **Workflow events**

| **Event Type** | **Data** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ESIGN` | NONE | This event gets fired after a user has successfully signed an agreement. |
| `REJECT` | NONE | This event is fired after a user rejects an agreement. |
| `PREFILL` | NONE | This event is fired after a user completes prefilling an agreement and sends it. |

### **Page Load events**

      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

## **Using events**

In order to use the events fired by Adobe Sign, the external application should include a callback handler in the parent page that embeds the Adobe Sign application UI.

The following example depicts an event handler that can be placed in the parent page:

```js
functioneventHandler(e){
    if(e.origin =="https://secure.echosign.com"){
        console.log("Event from Adobe Sign!", JSON.parse(e.data));
    }else{
        console.log("Do not process this!");
    }
}
if(!window.addEventListener){
    window.attachEvent('onmessage', eventHandler);
}else{
    window.addEventListener('message', eventHandler,false);
}
```
