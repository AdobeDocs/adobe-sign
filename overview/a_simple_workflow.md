# A Simple Workflow

![A simple workflow: overview](../img/sign_overview_2.png)

A very simple workflow:

1. [Send the document for signing](../api_usage/send_signing.md)
2. [Check the status of the agreement](../api_usage/check_status.md)
3. [If agreement not signed, send reminders](../api_usage/send_reminders.md)
4. [If all the signers have signed, download the agreement](../api_usage/download_agreement.md)

See the  [Terminology](terminology.md) section to understand the terms used by Adobe Sign.
