# Overview

As a developer, you can build a variety of integrations with Adobe Sign using just the APIs. Once built, integrations allow you to start the Adobe Sign signing experience entirely from within the external application.

You can also incorporate the functionality of Adobe Sign into any external applications by embedding the Adobe Sign UI within those applications. External applications can also receive status updates in real-time for transactions initiated using Adobe Sign. These external applications can retrieve and store copies of the signed agreements.

The Adobe Sign APIs can be used to:

- Send a document for e-signature
- Create and manage agreements
- Retrieve signed documents
- Archive signed documents
- Embed a signing UI in your app
- Send reminders
- Download audit trails
- [And a lot more!](https://acrobat.adobe.com/in/en/sign/capabilities.html)
